<h4> Real Time Bus Tracker Project </h4>

<h5> Description: </h5>
<p>The Real Time Bus Tracker, was a learning activity used in a course I am currently enrolled in. This project currently allows the user to see the bus stops between MIT, and Harvard, along with other stops on MBTA route 1. Upon opening, a map of Boston, MA is displayed, along with the bus route highlighted in maroon. </p>
